** Why I started this project?

The main reasons that drove me to start this repository are the
following:
- I would a fully open source radio with the source code of every
  components;
- a future proof code that will works for the next decade;
- learn PIC architecture and FPGA ecosystem (with Verilog language in
  this case);
- fully remote controllable radio without any external hardware.

** Features

** Architecture

** Folders

- [[./bootloader][bootloader]] : contains the verilog code for the bootloader and can be
  programmed with the ~programmer~;
- [[./docs][docs]] : contains a few documents published by David Fainitski N7DDC
  about the hardware board and his software;
- [[./mcu][mcu]] : the microcontroller firmware that controller the power of the
  radio and the display;
- [[./pcb][pcb]] : contains the PCB layout of Odyssey 2 version 1.2 and related
  BOM/geber;
- [[./programmer][programmer]] : the bootloader programmer that permits to control and
  configure from remote the radio.

** License

Each project has its license since the FPGA code was derived from
[[https://openhpsdr.org][openHPSDR]]. I tried to respect as much as possible each author citing
his work on each source file. If you find something wrong or not correctly
attributed feel free to open a pull request. thank you!
