** Why I started this project?

The main reasons that drove me to start this repository are the
following:
- I would a fully open source radio with the source code of every
  components;
- a future proof code that will works for the next decade;
- comprehensive radio information;
- learn PIC architecture and FPGA ecosystem (with Verilog HDL in
  this case);
- fully remote controllable radio without any external hardware.

** Features

In this section I expose only software changes that I made to the
respect of N7DDC software; you can find these characteristics on
[[./pcb/docs][pcb/docs]] folder.

- the programmer is written in C89 and therefore will be available for
  next decades. The basic commands are fully functional with the N7DDC
  bootloader.
- MCU is fully open source and documented
- more agile protocol between MCU and FPGA
- fully remote control of the bootloader (also the entering mode)
- display visualizes each stage and all configuration

For more information you can read each sub-system readme.

** Architecture

The following diagram is an high overview of the radio main components
and how they communicate and for which functionalities they are
responsible. For a lower level see [[./.img/ody2_block_diagram.jpg][N7DDC diagram]].

Full information about MCU functionalities and FPGA UART protocol can be
found in the [[./mcu/README.org][mcu]] readme.
For the FPGA you can find the bootloader specifications in [[./bootloader/README.org][bootloader]]
readme and the radio details in the [[./radio/README.org][radio]] readme.

** Folders

- [[./bootloader][bootloader]] : contains the verilog code for the bootloader and can be
  programmed with the ~programmer~;
- [[./mcu][mcu]] : the microcontroller firmware that controller the power of the
  radio and the display;
- [[./pcb][pcb]] : contains the PCB layout of Odyssey 2 version 1.2 and related
  BOM/geber;
- [[./pcb/docs][pcb/docs]] : contains a few documents published by David Fainitski N7DDC
  about the hardware board and the software;
- [[./programmer][programmer]] : the bootloader programmer that permits to control and
  configure from remote the radio.
- [[./radio][radio]] : contains the readme for the radio firmware since many
  functionalities are shared between protocol 1 and protocol 2.
- [[./radio/protocol1][radio/protocol1]] : the Angelia radio firmware with protocol
  version 1.
- [[./radio/protocol2][radio/protocol2]] : the Angelia radio firmware with protocol
  version 2.

** License

Each project has its license since the FPGA code was derived from
[[https://openhpsdr.org][openHPSDR]]. It is generally GPL version 2 or 3. I tried to respect as
much as possible each author citing his work on each source file. If
you find something wrong or not correctly attributed feel free to open
a pull request. Thank you for sharing with the community your code!
