* Odyssey 2 PCB

*IMPORTANT*: This is only a personal copy of the pcb/BOM version 1.2
 distributed by [[https://github.com/Dfinitski/Odyssey-2_2017_TRX][N7DDC]] on his repository. Therefore, the copyright
 remain entirely to David Fainitski (N7DDC).

To open the layout /lay6/ you need to use [[https://www.electronic-software-shop.com/lng/en/electronic-software/sprint-layout-60.html][Sprint Layout 6.0]]. The demo
version is enough to visualize the pcb.

** Schematics

There is no official schematics. The connections can be quite easily
followed using the layout software. If you need some basic reference
you can read the [[./schematics/Angelia-Anan100D.pdf][Angelia-Anan100D]] schematic since parts of it are the
same like RX front-ends. If you have done by your own the schematics
or part of it feel free to open a pull requests.
